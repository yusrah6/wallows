    <p>Wallow members Dylan Minnette, Braeden Lemasters, and Cole Preston started their  Alternative/Indie band in 2011.
        In April 2017, the band released their first single under the Wallows moniker, "Pleaser". The song would eventually reach number two 
        on the Spotify Global Viral 50 chart and number one on the KROQ Locals Only playlist. In May 2017, Wallows released a second single, 
        "Sun Tan" and began playing live shows in the Los Angeles area, selling out The Roxy and the Troubadour.Their third single, 
        "Uncomfortable", was released in September 2017.</p>
    <p>Wallows embarked on another leg of their Nothing Happens Tour in February 2020, for 15 additional stops. The band partnered with local
        non-profit charities in each of the cities in this leg of the tour such as Project Lazarus and the LGBT Center of Raleigh. Before
        each show, the band posted a list of donatable items for their attendees to bring (with the incentive of donating being a free Wallows 
        pin) on their social media accounts, and were able to garner a plethora of items to donate after each show. In an interview with 
        97X, a Tampa radio station, Minnette remarked that the nonprofit organization they partnered with in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Handy 
        Inc. shared that Wallows fans had brought an equivalent of five months' worth of supplies to the band's show.</p>
